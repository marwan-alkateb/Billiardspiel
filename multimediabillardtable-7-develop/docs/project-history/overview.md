# Project history
This directory contains documents from past project-groups that contributed to the MultimediaBilliardTable-project.  
These documents are compiled in here so that future project-groups can get an overview of where this project started, how it evolved over time and which experiences preceding project-groups gathered, so that new groups may benefit from the info.  

This README also provides a short summary for each project-group, though these summaries may not be accurate.  
Know that you always have the option to simply request access to the GitLab-projects of the previous groups from your professor.

## Group 1 (WS 18/19)
- planned construction of the billiard-table, including selection of materials/components
- the billiard-table is multi-purpose, as it can also be used ad a meeting-table
- developed first softwares, some for embedded systems
- implemented 'effects' as Unity-project
- first implementation of 'Game-Logic' in C++
- software architecture includes connecting components via MQTT and using Raspberry Pi units equipped with cameras to watch the table-pockets

## Group 2 (SS 19)
- implemented camera-tracking of the billiard-balls
- extended on the 'effects' Unity-project

## Group 3 (WS 19/20)
- cleanup, reworking
- re-implemented camera-tracking in Python
    - switched from regular camera to Kinect camera
    - switched from blob-detection to deep learning approach

## Group 4 (SS 20)
- reworked camera-tracking; removed Darknet (Deep Learning)
- introduced Simulator

## Group 5 (WS 20/21)
- significantly extended on documentation, including guidelines and workflows
- re-implemented software-components in C#, usually as Unity-projects

## Group 6 (SS 21)
- significantly reworked and extended on documentation
- added GitLab-pipeline with tests, builds and documentation-generation
- merged Unity projects
- improvements and new feature implementations
