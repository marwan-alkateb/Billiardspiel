2. go to the Product Backlog board in gitlab

3. for each User Story you finished:


    3.1 summarize what the story was about

    3.2 show your result in the running project

    3.3 ask for questions (and answer them)

    3.4 a) if the PO is happy with the result and thinks that the User Story is fully implemented you can close it 

    3.4 b) if the anything is missing for the User Story that the PO didn't wrote down as explanation for it you can close the User Story and the PO has to add a new User Story for that

    3.4 c) if the PO is not happy or anything is missing for the User Story that the PO wrote down as explanation for the User Story you can not close the User Story and have to work on it in the next Sprint
