# Scrum

## General Terms

### User Story

    As <xy> I want <abcd> so that <abcdef>.

A User Story is written by the [Product Owner](#product-owner). It represents a (customer) request and must not be formulated too specifically or too imprecisely.

### Issue / Task

An issue / a task is created by the [Development Team](#development-team) and depends on a User Story. One or more tasks have to be formulated for a user story.

### Product Backlog

A Product Backlog is a list of requirements. It is not a to-do list, but rather a list of all the features that the customer would like to have integrated into his project (formulated as User Stories). The Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing these User Stories. In the course of the development process, the product backlog can be changed and re-prioritized as required.

### Sprint

The Scrum Sprint is a clearly defined period and forms the basis of a Scrum project. All sprints are roughly the same length, usually last between two and four weeks and always follow one another.
Within a Sprint there usually are the following topics:

* [Sprint Planning](#planning)
* [Daily](#daily)
* [Sprint Review](#review)
* [Sprint Retrospective](#retrospective)

For a detailed workflow explanation read [this](/workflow/scrum-workflow.md).

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is similar to the Product Backlog. All User Stories with its tasks are added to the Sprint Backlog during the Planning and Taskbreakdown but they can not be changed during a Sprint.

### Increment

The Increment (or Product Increment) is potentially releasable. It includes all items from the Product Backlog that were implemented in the course of the current Sprint. It also includes the value of all Increments that were implemented in the previous Sprints.
So it is almost always the current product in its last release state.

## Roles

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.
The Scrum Master also moderates the meetings. 

### Product Owner

The Product Owner (PO) is a member of the Agile Team responsible for defining Stories and prioritizing the Product Backlog to streamline the execution of program priorities while maintaining the conceptual and technical integrity of the Features or components for the team.

### Development Team

The development team implements all features within the sprints. The team also decides for itself how to implement the features and what they have to do for them.

## Meetings

### Daily

_Participants_: Development Team (and Product Owner and / or Scrum Master if wanted)

The Development Team meets on every single day where everybody shortly tells the team what he / she did the last day and what he / she is going to do during the next day. In addition, ambiguities can be clarified here and it can be discussed if you get stuck. The Daily usually lasts around 15 minutes or less.

### Planning

_Participants_: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

With the Sprint Planning a new Sprint starts. The Product Owner presents the prioritized Product Backlog (User Stories) step by step to the team, beginning whith the most important one (after each user story that is not finished within the last sprint is taken to the new one). Each presented User Story is added to the Sprint Backlog. Whenever the teams thinks that they can't do anything more during the next Sprint they stop and no other User Story is going to be presented. 

### Taskbreakdown

_Participants_: Development Team (and Product Owner and / or Scrum Master if wanted)

The Development Team plans the new Sprint. For each User Story added to the Sprint Backlog the Team decides what they need to do and therefor they write Tasks / Issues. If anything is still not clear the team can ask the Product Owner to explain the User Story.

### Review

_Participants_: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team (and Stakeholder if wanted)

With the Sprint Review and the Sprint Retrospective the current Sprint ends. In the Sprint Review the Development Team presents the fully working and completely implemented Increment to the Product Owner (and the Stakeholder). Each task which is not completely finished is not presented. 
In this way the Stakeholder can communicate to the Product Owner whether the implemented functionalities or designs are the way he wants it or not.

### Retrospective

_Participants_: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

The development process and the cooperation are analyzed in the Retrospective. You record what went well and what went bad during the last Sprint and you decide on measures to improve it.
