# Know your tools
Experience has shown that not all project-contributors immediately possess a sufficient proficiency with the use of certain tools that have so far been vital to the project. These tools namely are Git and the Unity-Engine & -Editor.  
To give you a better start into this project and to make contributing easier, it is recommended that you consume some learning-resources first before you start contributing, if you are not confident in your abilities to use these tools.

## Git
To effectively contribute to a project that uses Git for version control, you need to understand the essentials of how Git works and how to use Git-clients to manage a repository.  
You should be able to:
- commit your progress
- create and switch between branches
- merge branches and resolve merge-conflicts
- exchange updates with remote-repositories via push, pull, etc.
- configure .gitignore-files to ignore files or directories that should not be put under version-control
- undo changes, such as reverting commits or reverting uncommitted changes

There are many GUI-clients out there that can make using Git easier, but if all else fails you should always be able to fall back to the basic command-line-tool and solve problems with git-commands.  
One recommended resource to learn these things is the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), where the chapters 1 - 3 and 5 should cover everything you need. For certain edge-cases like undoing specific things, you can usually find helpful command-sequences on sites like StackOverflow.  

## Unity
You likely work with Unity for the first time in this project and thus have no prior experience. If that is the case, you should go through a tutorial that explains to you the essentials about how the Unity Engine works and how to use the Unity Editor.  
[Unity's own learning-platform](https://learn.unity.com/) should be able to help you with that.  
This tutorial can potentially be quite time-consuming, so it may be advisable for a new project-group to collectively decide to spend some time at the start of their project-iteration for just getting familiar with Unity.
