# Work-flow

## Scrum light

The Development Team usually has the size of 3 - 9 people (without Product Owner and Scrum Master). Because we are significantly more than that and Mr. Frömmer has to grade us, we are doing Scrum light. 

Therefor we split our team in 4 subgroups and let Mr. Frömmer take part in each meeting, although he just represents a stakeholder.

## Daily

In this project, we left it to the individual teams to decide how they want to make Dailies or not, i.e. whether they actually do them daily or every two days or only as a weekly.

## Weekly

In addition to the team-internal Dailies, a Weekly takes place with everyone once a week, so that you can also find out about the status of the other teams.

## Planning

The Planning takes place in the large group with everyone. Each subteam decides for themselves how many user stories they want to implement during this Sprint.

## Taskbreakdown

The Taskbreakdown takes place within the subteam. If there are User Stories that affect several teams, these teams should also sit down together.

## Review and Retrospective

Review and Retro, like Planning, take place in the large group with everyone.

## Iteration

The duration of each Sprint is two weeks.
