# Rules

This file lists all the rules that are currently supported by this project ordered by what game mode they apply to.

cue ball = the white ball to be hit with the cue stick.  
object ball = Every ball with a number on it (i.e. 1-15 for Eightball and 1-9 for Nineball).

## Eightball

The groups(full and half) will be assigned to the players upon pocketing a ball after the break. So on the first shot of the game no groups can be assigned. Should the player pocket multiple balls of different groups, no groups will be assigned. The player will be assigned the group of the ball they pocketed and the opponent will be assigned the other group.  

As long as the player pockets at least one of their balls (both groups before the assignment) and doesn't commit a foul they can keep playing.

A foul results in it being the opponent's turn and the opponent being allowed to place the cue ball wherever they want.

A foul occurs in any of the following situations:
- The cue ball is pocketed.
- The player hits a ball that is not of his assigned group before any of his balls.
- A ball of the opponents group is pocketed.
- The player hits a ball of his group but no ball is pocketed or hits a cushion. 
- The cue ball does not hit any ball.
- On the break shot the player does not pocket any ball other than the black or cue ball or have at least four balls, excluding the cue ball, hit a cushion.

A player wins in any of these situations:
- The player pockets the black ball after pocketing every ball of his assigned group in the pocket opposite of where they pocketed the last of their assigned balls.
- The opponent pockets the black ball without first pocketing every ball of his assigned group.
- The opponent pockets the black ball together with the cue ball.
- The opponent is allowed to pocket the black ball but fails to pocket it in the pocket opposite of where they pocketed the last of their assigned balls.

## Nineball

A player can keep playing until they fail to pocket a ball or commit a foul.

A foul results in it being the opponent's turn and the opponent being allowed to place the cue ball wherever they want.

A foul occurs in any of the following situations:
- The cue ball is pocketed.
- The nineball is pocketed before all other object balls are pocketed.
    - Here the nineball will also be put back on the table in its original position.
- The first ball to be hit by the cue ball does not have the lowest number on the table.
- The cue ball does not hit any ball.
- The nine- and cue balls are pocketed together.

The game ends as soon as a player pockets the nineball after pocketing every other object ball.

## Trickshot
At the beginning of a game the player can choose how many balls they want to pocket, in how many turns they want to do it and which pocket they want to use.

The game is lost in the following situations:
- The number of available hits goes down to zero.
- A ball was pocketed into the wrong pocket.

If all required balls are pocketed before the turns run out the game is won.
