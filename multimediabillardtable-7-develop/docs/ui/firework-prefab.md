# Firework Prefab

This is an explanation of what you need and what to do to use the existing firework prefab. 

## Preparation

1. To display the firework prefab you need the following packages: `Visual Effect Graph` and `Universal Render Pipeline`. Add them using the package manager:

![step two](../resources/images/firework_prefab_2.png)
![step three](../resources/images/firework_prefab_3.png)
2. Create a `Render Pipeline` folder inside `Assets`. This step is optional, but should be done for consistency.

## Usage

You can find the firework prefab in Unity inside of `Assets/Visual Effects`. If you want to use it, drag and drop it into the outline of the project (left upper corner in Unity, called *Hierarchie*).
